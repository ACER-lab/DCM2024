The Helmholtz Research School provides PhD training and education in the brain and cognition domain. The training in the school and research of the Helmholtz institute are strongly driven by fundamental theory and empirical science but can also have implications for clinical diagnosis and therapy. Based at Utrecht University (UU), the Helmholtz Institute unites scientists from different disciplines to conduct multi-disciplinary research in experimental psychology, focusing on a number of designated topics, each with their own mission statement.
